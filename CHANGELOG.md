## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

Initial public release.

### Added

- `Client` with deterministic, local-compute `assign(experiment, user)` — no network on the hot
  path — and non-blocking, buffered `track(event, payload)`.
- `getPrompt(experiment, user, default)` — variant prompt with an in-code fallback that survives
  a full LLMJury outage.
- `getVariables(experiment, user, defaults)` — per-variant configuration merged over defaults.
- `wrapClient(providerClient, experiment)` — setup-once interception of OpenAI/Anthropic-shaped
  model calls (latency, tokens, errors, time-to-first-token) plus explicit `ModelCall` scoping.
- `ready()` promise that resolves once declared experiments are fetched.
- Versioned config polling with `If-None-Match`/`304` and immediate refresh when ingest reports a
  newer `config_version`.
- Bounded in-memory event buffer with background flush, bounded retry, and offline spill/replay
  (file-backed in Node, IndexedDB in the browser; 24h bound, original timestamps).
- Frozen cross-language bucketing contract (`spec/bucketing.md`) with the shared conformance
  fixture — identical assignments across Python, TypeScript, and Java.
- Dual ESM + CJS build with full type declarations; zero runtime dependencies; Node 18+ and
  modern browsers.
